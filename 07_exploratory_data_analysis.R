# 7.3 VARIATION

# 1. Explore the distribution of each of the x, y, and z variables in diamonds. What do you learn? 
# Think about a diamond and how you might decide which dimension is the length, width, and depth.
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = x))

ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y))

ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = z))

# Explore the distribution of price. Do you discover anything unusual or surprising? (Hint: 
# Carefully think about the binwidth and make sure you try a wide range of values.)
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = price))

ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = price),
                 binwidth = 5)
view(diamonds %>% 
  count(cut_width(price, 100)) )

summary(diamonds$price)

# There are many many diamonds sold for 500-1000$
# It's strange that there are not many just below $1500


# 3. How many diamonds are 0.99 carat? How many are 1 carat? What do you think is the cause of the 
# difference?
diamonds %>% filter(between(carat, 0.99, 1)) %>%
  count(carat)

# There are 23 of .99 vs 1558 of 1. If carat is the weight of the diamond, my guess is that it is 
# easier to sell a diamond with a "round" weight

# 4. Compare and contrast coord_cartesian() vs xlim() or ylim() when zooming in on a histogram. What 
# happens if you leave binwidth unset? What happens if you try and zoom so only half a bar shows?


ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = price),
                 binwidth = 50) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(100, 5000))

ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = price),
                 binwidth = 50) +
  xlim(c(100, 5000))

#xlim cuts everything outside that range. coord_cartesian just does a zoom

ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = price))
# if you don't specify binwidth, ggplot generates 30 bins
